# HR-Dashboard
I have successfully completed a small project on an HR dashboard using Tableau. The dashboard is designed to showcase various insightful graphs related to different aspects of the organization's workforce. It provides a comprehensive view of the HR data, categorized by departments, and includes important metrics such as attrition, the number of employees in different age groups, job satisfaction levels, attrition rates based on gender, and attrition rates for various age groups.

The dashboard employs a variety of graph types to present the data in a visually appealing and easy-to-understand manner. Each graph is carefully selected to best represent the specific HR metrics it conveys. The project demonstrates my ability to handle data visualization using Tableau and my understanding of HR analytics.

Through this project, stakeholders can quickly assess the current state of the organization's workforce and identify potential areas of improvement or concern. The department-wise breakdown allows for targeted analysis and helps HR professionals make informed decisions to address any issues related to attrition or job satisfaction. Additionally, the graphical representation of attrition rates for different age groups and genders allows for a deeper understanding of workforce dynamics.

Overall, this HR dashboard project showcases my proficiency in data visualization, data analysis, and the ability to derive meaningful insights from HR-related data. It serves as a valuable tool for HR professionals and management to make data-driven decisions and enhance the overall effectiveness of the organization's workforce management strategies.
